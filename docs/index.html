            <h1>Car Crashes Are Becoming More Dangerous, and There is No Clear Consensus Why</h1>
            <p><small style="color: black;">Ben Adams, Jack Troy</small><br /><small>Nov 30, 2023</small></p>
            <p>While the number of car crashes in Allegheny County has been on a slow but steady decline since the early
                2000’s,
                collisions across this region have only become more severe over time. From 2004 to 2022, reports from
                PennDOT
                indicate that a 39% decrease in crashes involving only minor injuries has come with an alarming
                tradeoff—a
                marked 47% increase in crashes resulting in major injuries over the same time span. Not only are
                Allegheny
                County collisions leaving behind more acute injuries, but these crashes have also become more deadly.
                The number
                of fatal accidents in the county has increased by over 20% since 2004 and is up more than 45% since the
                onset of
                COVID-19 in 2020.

            <p>Trends in Allegheny County reflect a similar and concerning nationwide phenomena, where vehicular
                collisions are
                becoming <a
                    href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/22/us-roadway-deaths-rise-even-as-cars-get-safer.html">less
                    numerous yet noticeably more fatal and dangerous for those involved</a>. With modern cars boasting
                new,
                innovative safety features like lane assist, back-up cameras, and blind-spot indicators, experts are
                left
                uncertain why car accidents are becoming more severe and unsure how to approach the problem.
            </p>
            <p>There’s no clear consensus on what exactly is causing these particular reversals in traffic safety. While
                all of
                these factors likely make roads more dangerous, experts and officials have assigned varying degrees of
                blame to
                risky driving habits brought on by the pandemic, distracted driving, ever-larger cars and trucks,
                quieter
                vehicles and reductions in police enforcement of traffic laws.
            </p>
            <p>A primary cause could remain elusive — if there’s one at all — but there are clear trends about who is
                being
                injured in crashes and to what degree, offering clues to lawmakers and transportation safety officials
                as they
                seek to make the county’s roads safer.
            </p>
            <p>PennDOT has recorded a variety of outliers in traffic safety metrics since the onset of the pandemic in
                2020.
                Accidents were substantially down in 2020, as were total injuries, potentially because the shutdowns
                kept
                drivers off the road. For the drivers who did go out, they became more likely to speed, run red lights
                and
                demonstrate other reckless behaviors, <a
                    href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fatal-car-crash-increase-risky-driving-rcna43969">according
                    to experts</a>. These habits appeared to have spilled over into 2021 and 2022. For example, the
                number of
                accidents involving speeding in the county hit a 12-year high in 2022 and have since remained above that
                level.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pandemic also produced — and coincided with — changes in how police enforce traffic laws, leaving
                the poor
                habits of drivers unchecked as roads began to fill again.
            </p>
            <h2>Header example</h2>
            <p>
                Looking specifically at major injury counts and fatalities, risky driving brought on by the pandemic
                could be
                having serious consequences in Allegheny County. Fatalities hit a 17-year high in 2022, and major
                injuries hit
                their highest level since at least 2004, the furthest extent of PennDOT’s data. Changes in traffic law
                enforcement could also be to blame, brought on by safety-related cutbacks during the pandemic, a
                shortage of
                police officers and policy changes in many departments to reduce racial disparities in traffic stops.
            </p>
            <p>But the frequency of major injuries relative to the total number of accidents has been on the rise since
                well
                before the pandemic: Distracted driving has become the scourge of transportation safety officials, in
                many ways
                overtaking drunk driving as a leading concern and undoing progress made in that regard.

            </script>
            <p>Car builds and designs themselves may also be playing a role in rising crash severity. As suburban
                families trade
                in their tiny sedans for minivans and SUVs, the average weight of American cars have also subsequently
                shot up,
                <a
                    href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-08/american-cars-are-developing-a-serious-weight-problem">with
                    experts citing that the American cars are over 150 pounds heavier on average than they were just
                    three years
                    ago</a>. Increased car weights mean higher energy collisions, resulting in more intense crashes
                compared to
                just a few years ago. Vehicle noise suppression is also an emerging consideration for increases in fatal
                crashes, as sleek modern cars with advanced mufflers could be making it harder for pedestrians to hear
                automobiles coming through at intersections.
            </p>
            <p>Ultimately, while it is unclear which factors influence crash severity the most, drivers within Allegheny
                County
                and beyond can take mitigating measures to make roads safer by following traffic laws and staying
                focused on the
                road as experts devise plans to make driving a safer experience.</p>
