    <h1>Car Crashes Are Becoming More Dangerous, and There is No Clear Consensus Why</h1>
    <p>While the number of car crashes in Allegheny County has been on a slow but steady decline since the early 2000’s,
        collisions across this region have only become more severe over time. From 2004 to 2022, reports from PennDOT
        indicate that a 39% decrease in crashes involving only minor injuries has come with an alarming tradeoff—a
        marked 47% increase in crashes resulting in major injuries over the same time span. Not only are Allegheny
        County collisions leaving behind more acute injuries, but these crashes have also become more deadly. The number
        of fatal accidents in the county has increased by over 20% since 2004 and is up more than 45% since the onset of
        COVID-19 in 2020.
    </p>
    <p>Trends in Allegheny County reflect a similar and concerning nationwide phenomena, where vehicular collisions are
        becoming <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/22/us-roadway-deaths-rise-even-as-cars-get-safer.html">less
            numerous yet noticeably more fatal and dangerous for those involved</a>. With modern cars boasting new,
        innovative safety features like lane assist, back-up cameras, and blind-spot indicators, experts are left
        uncertain why car accidents are becoming more severe and unsure how to approach the problem.
    </p>
    <p>There’s no clear consensus on what exactly is causing these particular reversals in traffic safety. While all of
        these factors likely make roads more dangerous, experts and officials have assigned varying degrees of blame to
        risky driving habits brought on by the pandemic, distracted driving, ever-larger cars and trucks, quieter
        vehicles and reductions in police enforcement of traffic laws.
    </p>
    <p>A primary cause could remain elusive — if there’s one at all — but there are clear trends about who is being
        injured in crashes and to what degree, offering clues to lawmakers and transportation safety officials as they
        seek to make the county’s roads safer.
    </p>
    <p>PennDOT has recorded a variety of outliers in traffic safety metrics since the onset of the pandemic in 2020.
        Accidents were substantially down in 2020, as were total injuries, potentially because the shutdowns kept
        drivers off the road. For the drivers who did go out, they became more likely to speed, run red lights and
        demonstrate other reckless behaviors, <a
            href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fatal-car-crash-increase-risky-driving-rcna43969">according
            to experts</a>. These habits appeared to have spilled over into 2021 and 2022. For example, the number of
        accidents involving speeding in the county hit a 12-year high in 2022 and have since remained above that level.
    </p>
    <p>
        The pandemic also produced — and coincided with — changes in how police enforce traffic laws, leaving the poor
        habits of drivers unchecked as roads began to fill again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Looking specifically at major injury counts and fatalities, risky driving brought on by the pandemic could be
        having serious consequences in Allegheny County. Fatalities hit a 17-year high in 2022, and major injuries hit
        their highest level since at least 2004, the furthest extent of PennDOT’s data. Changes in traffic law
        enforcement could also be to blame, brought on by safety-related cutbacks during the pandemic, a shortage of
        police officers and policy changes in many departments to reduce racial disparities in traffic stops.
    </p>
    <p>But the frequency of major injuries relative to the total number of accidents has been on the rise since well
        before the pandemic: Distracted driving has become the scourge of transportation safety officials, in many ways
        overtaking drunk driving as a leading concern and undoing progress made in that regard.
    </p>
    <p>Car builds and designs themselves may also be playing a role in rising crash severity. As suburban families trade
        in their tiny sedans for minivans and SUVs, the average weight of American cars have also subsequently shot up,
        <a
            href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-08/american-cars-are-developing-a-serious-weight-problem">with
            experts citing that the American cars are over 150 pounds heavier on average than they were just three years
            ago</a>. Increased car weights mean higher energy collisions, resulting in more intense crashes compared to
        just a few years ago. Vehicle noise suppression is also an emerging consideration for increases in fatal
        crashes, as sleek modern cars with advanced mufflers could be making it harder for pedestrians to hear
        automobiles coming through at intersections.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, while it is unclear which factors influence crash severity the most, drivers within Allegheny County
        and beyond can take mitigating measures to make roads safer by following traffic laws and staying focused on the
        road as experts devise plans to make driving a safer experience.</p>
