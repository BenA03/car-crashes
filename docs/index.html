            <h1>Crashes are down in Allegheny County. So why are roadway deaths at an all-time high?</h1>
            <p><small style="color: black;">Ben Adams, Jack Troy</small><br /><small>Nov 30, 2023</small></p>
            <section id="introduction">
                <p>Since the heyday of American car culture in the mid-20th century, fatalities per million miles have
                    <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/12/how-safety-improved-over-60-years/">generally
                        declined</a> thanks to safety improvements like seatbelts and airbags.</p>
                <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration puts it simply: <a
                        href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/newer-cars-are-safer-cars#:~:text=Vehicle%20safety%20has%20changed%20drastically,safety%20features%20to%20protect%20you.">"Newer
                        cars are safer cars."</a> But several alarming trends across the country, including in Allegheny
                    County, suggest that it’s not so simple.</p>
                <p>From 2016 to 2022, PennDOT reported a 22% increase in major injuries per accident in Allegheny
                    County, and a 31% rise in fatalities during that same time period. Worse yet, it appears that the
                    pandemic has accelerated these declines in safety. In 2021, major injuries hit their peak under
                    criteria introduced in 2016. Last year, 84 people died in crashes, the most in 17 years.</p>

                <p>Vehicular collisions are becoming less numerous in the county, but noticeably more likely to <a
                        href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/22/us-roadway-deaths-rise-even-as-cars-get-safer.html">death
                        or severe injury</a>, even as innovative features like lane assist, back-up cameras and
                    blind-spot indicators have become standard. This apparently paradoxical trend indicates that there’s
                    more to car safety than what the federal safety ratings system has to say.</p>
                <p>Pandemic-era behavioral changes, reductions in traffic enforcement, ever-larger vehicles and
                    distracted driving could all be to blame. Experts say it’s likely a combination of these factors,
                    giving policymakers and regulators a tight knot to untangle as they try to right the course of
                    traffic safety in the county. </p>

                <h2>How We Drive</h2>
                <p>As streets thinned out at the onset of the pandemic, drivers who did go out were more likely to speed, run red lights and engage in other reckless behaviors, according to survey data from the <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/2021/10/aaa-finds-better-behavior-behind-the-wheel-but-theres-room-for-improvement/">AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety</a>.</p>
                <p>Traffic volume mostly <a href="https://tripnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/COVID_American_Journal_of_Transportation_05-26-2021.pdf">returned to normal</a> after 2020, but data suggests that driving habits did not. Major injuries from running red lights, aggressive driving and impaired driving have all hit historic highs between 2021 and 2022.</p>
                <p>COVID-19 isn’t entirely to blame for an uptick in unsafe driving, though. Compared to 2014, last year saw 30% more collisions involving distracted drivers. <a href="https://exchange.aaa.com/safety/distracted-driving/">Some experts</a> blame cell phone use and flashy car dashboard touchscreens.</p>
                <p>In many ways, distracted driving has surpassed drunk driving as a leading concern for transportation safety officials. In 2004, PennDOT reported 28 more distracted driving accidents than drunk driving accidents in Allegheny County. Last year, that gap grew to 633 accidents.</p>
                <iframe class = "bumper" title="Distracted Drivers on the Rise" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-i1FQT" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/i1FQT/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();
                </script>
                <p>Police have traditionally been tasked with deterring unnecessary risk-taking on the road through traffic stops. Between staffing issues, pandemic-era cutbacks to limit officers’ interactions with the public and reforms meant to limit racial discrimination in traffic enforcement, that’s changed.</p>
                <p>For instance, Pittsburgh City Council <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/pittsburgh-mayor-ed-gainey-training-police-ordinance-preventing-secondary-traffic-stops/">passed legislation in 2021</a> to ban officers from pulling over motorists for minor infractions, such as burnt out headlights or recently expired inspection stickers.</p>
                <p>The police department announced its intention to resume these traffic stops in 2023, but cities such as <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia/philadelphia-police-wont-stop-drivers-minor-offenses-20220303.html">Philadelphia</a> and <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/the-seattle-seesaw-traffic-tickets-from-police-have-dropped-90/">Seattle</a> have gotten the changes to stick, motivated in part by the fact that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/31/us/police-traffic-stops-killings.html">traffic stops themselves can result in death for motorists</a>.</p>
                <p>This reduction in enforcement may have come with a cost, allowing drivers to “think we can get away with it,” Jonathan Adkins, CEO of the Governors Highway Safety Association, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/06/1167980495/americas-roads-are-more-dangerous-as-police-pull-over-fewer-drivers">told NPR</a>.</p>
                <p>"There's not enforcement out there, [police are] hesitant to write tickets. And we're seeing the results of that,” Adkins said.</p>
                <p>There’s no definite link between traffic enforcement and Allegheny County’s increasingly dangerous roadways, but high-visibility, safety-focused enforcement efforts are generally shown to reduce risky driving.</p>
